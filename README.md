# docker-pinpointing-experiments

Docker image for pinpointing experiments.
It runs a simple HTTP server using which the experiments can be started.


# Prerequisites: 

java 8+, maven 3+, docker

# How to build

1. Invoke the following command in the root directory of the repository:
    ```
    mvn clean install docker:build
    ```
    This command will create a docker image with name 'pinpointing',
    from which docker containers can be created and started.

# How to run

1. Invoke the following command:

    ```
    mvn docker:start
    ```

    This creates and runs the container with the experiments called
    `pinpointing-container`, which is accessible on the port `8888`.
    
    Alternatively, one can create and start the container using the 
    docker command:
    
    ```
    docker run -d -p 8888:80 --name pinpointing-container pinpointing
    ```
    
    You can change the port value `8888` or the name `pinpointing-container`
    to different values.

1. Point your browser to the address of the host machine with the configured port,
    e.g., `http://localhost:8888/`.

1. Run the experiments.

1. Stop and remove the container by invoking:
    ```
    docker stop pinpointing-container && docker rm -v pinpointing-container
    ```
    Removing the container may take a long time, probably because it is
    removing huge number of small files generated by the experiments.

While the container is running, you can connect to it (as by ssh) by invoking:
```
docker exec -it pinpointing-container bash
```
