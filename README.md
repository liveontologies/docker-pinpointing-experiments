# docker-pinpointing-experiments

Docker image for pinpointing experiments.
It runs a simple HTTP server using which the experiments can be started.


# Quick start:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 8888:80 --name pinpointing-container liveontologies/pinpointing
   ```
   Open a web browser with the address http://localhost:8888/ or http://0.0.0.0:8888.   

# Prerequisites: 

- docker for running the experiments container
- java 8+, maven 3+ for compiling the docker image

# How to build

1. Invoke the following command in the root directory of the repository:
    ```
    mvn clean install docker:build
    ```
    This command will create a docker image with name 'pinpointing',
    from which docker containers can be created and started.

# How to run

1. Invoke the following command:

    ```
    mvn docker:start
    ```

    This creates and runs the container with the experiments called
    `pinpointing-container`, which is accessible on the port `8888`.
    
    Alternatively, one can create and start the container using the 
    docker command shown in [Quick Start](#quick-start).
    There one can also change the port value `8888` or the name 
    `pinpointing-container` to different values.

1. Point your browser to the address of the host machine with the configured port,
    e.g., http://localhost:8888/.

1. Use the web interface to configure and run the experiments.

   While the container is running, one can connect to it from the shell,
   which is useful for inspecting the files in case of problems:

    ```
    docker exec -it pinpointing-container bash
    ```

1. To stop the web server, terminate the process started by `mvn docker:start`.
   If the process has started using the `docker` command, one should stop
   and remove the container by invoking:
    ```
    docker stop pinpointing-container && docker rm -v pinpointing-container
    ```
    Removing the container may take a long time, probably because it is
    removing huge number of small files generated by the experiments.
